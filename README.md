# Geometric Algebra Resources

A curated list of Geometric Algebra resources, inspired by [awesome](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) lists. Also see [pygae/awesome-geometric-algebra](https://github.com/pygae/awesome-geometric-algebra), [Geometric Algebra Explorer](https://ga-explorer.netlify.app/index.php/ga-online-resources/)  and [ Geometric Algebra: A collection of useful resources](https://bleyer.org/dw/doku.php?id=geometric_algebra)

**NOTE** In order to avoid ambiguity and confusion, the term "**Geometric Algebra**" has been appropriated here to refer exclusively to the unified mathematical formalism developed by **David Hestenes** and others for use in Physics, Mathematics and Computer Science. It is not used as merely another term for **Clifford Algebra** since it has been designed to supercede several different mathematical formalisms used in Physics that have redundant content.

- [Geometric Algebra in Three Dimensions](https://www.cv.nrao.edu/~mmorgan2/resources/geo3.html) a slightly rogue website as failure to adopt the unified formalism developed by Dr. David Hestenes, use of the term "Clifford Product" and  a statement made regarding early introduction of Geometric Algebra to University undergraduates and high school students suggests an ignorance of the work of David Hestenes and others specifically on this matter over the last 30 - 40 years. It has been like watching tar drop. First David Hestenes wrote many times about the difficulty of getting his peers and graduate students to adopt the formalism and then undergraduates and high schools. All the while there has been the same kind of establishment resistance to reform in high school and university as in education reform in general with people wanting to keep knowledge silos and established curriculums in place. 
  
 "While I agree with this ambition in general, I believe its advocates make the mistake of jumping too quickly into highly specialized disciplines such as quantum physics and general relativity. While it is good to know that each of these important subjects can be covered by the geometric algebra toolset, true adoption as the standard language for mathematical physics must start at a much more basic level. Preferably, in my view, it should be introduced to students as soon as they are prepared to advance beyond purely scalar mathematics and begin to talk about higher-dimensional objects like vectors."
